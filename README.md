### Abstract
 The number of people using online shopping platforms is increasing gradually in the
 world. As a result, huge and competitive markets are formed. To prosper in these harsh
 market conditions, sellers offer customers various benefits. One of the commonly used
 methods is the contingent free shipping application. For sellers to be successful in this
 application, the threshold value for the contingent free shipping option should be adjusted
 accurately. In this project, the optimization of the threshold value for contingent free shipping
 is discussed. Throughout the project, methods such as effect formulation, statistical
 distribution fitting, and scenario simulations were utilized. As a result, using the discussed
 method, it was possible to obtain a %5.36 increase in revenue with the analyzed data.
 Key Words: Contingent free shipping, threshold value, shopping basket, e-commerce,
